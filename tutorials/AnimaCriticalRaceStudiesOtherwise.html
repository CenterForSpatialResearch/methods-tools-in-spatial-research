        <h1>Anima: Critical Race Studies Otherwise</h1>
        <h3>Ezekiel Dixon-Román</h3>
        
        <p>Let me begin by extending my appreciation to Laura Kurgan and Adelin Chum for organizing this workshop. I also want express what an honor it is to share the stage with Beth Coleman and Wendy Chun. Both of whom I consider to be dynamic thinkers and artist who have contributed many gifts to the field, pushing and challenging the discourse on race, media, and computation. Needless to say, I look forward to our conversation during the Q&A.</p>

        <p>I’d like to begin my comments with speaking a bit to my own scholarly and intellectual trajectory in thinking through questions of quantification. Through this I think it will help to frame how I have come to the wrestles and interventions on quantification that I make but also speak more specifically to how.</p>
        
        <p>One of the things that I suspect is less well known about me outside of the education research circles, is that I was trained as a quantitative social scientist and my PhD is in psychometrics. When I went into the study of psychometrics my main interest was on processes of power and marginalization and the ways in which they have an effect in shaping social and developmental processes. In fact, it was my interest in developmental processes that actually even brought me to questions in the field of education. I was especially interested in how quantitative methods might be used to examine processes of power.</p>
        
        <p>Yet, my interest in power and processes of marginalization brought me to critical theory, even before psychometrics. While I was at the University of Chicago in the Masters in the social sciences program, I was introduced to critical theory from scholars such as Cathy Cohen, Iris Marion Young, and Michael Dawson. Through critical theory, I found a language and discourse that immediately helped me to begin to make sense of the wrestles and questions I had with regard to power and processes of marginalization. Thus, as I went on to pursue my PhD, I approached the study of psychometrics from a radically different frame of critical theory. While many of my classmates were studying psychometrics for careers in research and development, I was more interested in making the practices and technologies of quantification my object of study.</p>
        
        <p>I went on to do my postdoc at Northwestern University and had the opportunity to spend time with the late Ernesto Laclau, the post-Marxist, poststructuralist political theorist. Laclau gifted me with a strong philosophical foundation I did not necessarily have from my graduate studies. Although I was studying critical theory, I did not have a way of understanding the branches and perspectives of thought in philosophy. I didn't have a systematic way of understanding philosophy. It was through there, as well as other cultural theory courses, that helped to really give me a much more systematic understanding of philosophy and cultural theory.</p>
        
        <p>As I began to work on my first book, initially my intervention was a project of deconstruction. Beginning really with this broader concern of the dualism of nature and culture and even the category of the human in relation to nature. In December of 2011, my colleague John Jackson was reviewing a set of books. He reviewed a book for Duke University Press and one of the books he received in compensation was Vicki Kirby’s (2011) <i>Quantum Anthropologies</i>. He immediately texted me and said he's reading this book that sounds like they're doing something similar to what I was going after with regard to quantification. He said you need to read it. I read it and we read it together and immediately my whole project was shifted. I could no longer continue down the route of a strict poststructuralist or deconstructionist intervention on nature and culture. Vicki Kirby's project completely opened up a whole new literature for me, a whole new way of understanding the false dualism of nature and culture, its relationship to quantification, and how to think about even the process of quantitative inquiry differently.</p>
        
        <p>Through working with Vicki Kirby's work, I began to become influenced by Barad’s agential realism as well as Deleuze neo-materialism. I began a process of literally trying to rethink a new materialist (de)construction of the nature/culture dualism. Then from there, I worked through its implications, on the one hand, to theories of social reproduction and, on the other hand, rethinking of quantification. For me, these two things could not have been done separately, one had implications for the other. The discursive move of Modernity long entwined the discourses of power with quantification. Thus, I could not do one without making interventions on the other.</p>
        
        <p>I employed Barad’s concept of apparatus as a way of thinking about the technologies and even practices of measurement. I took on even Barad’s idea of posthumanist performativity, or intra-action, also as a way of thinking about the ways in which measurement is engaging in intra-active practices of boundary-making and producing agential cuts of what matters and what doesn't matter or producing differences that make a difference. I also took on and extended Barad’s concept of diffraction. Barad employs the quantum physics concept of diffraction as a method of reading through disciplinary theories, reading one through the other, a kind of generative deconstructive move in order to recuperate or account for that which is excluded from mattering in the other disciplinary theory. Barad is actually trying to work with difference in a productive way, with a particular focus on mattering matter in and through the diffractive process. The other important part of what Barad is doing with diffraction is that as theories have their boundary-making practices - disciplines are disciplining the boundaries - and she insightfully and sharply is thinking through how to get beyond those disciplinary epistemic boundaries in order to produce a much sharper lens of phenomena. Thus, I rethink diffraction in a way that accounts for the boundary-making practices of methods. Like theories, methods engage in boundary-making practices and, as a result, influence the ways in which we can rethink those boundaries by reading through the produced data of each, toward producing a more complicated understanding of the world. Unlike the triangulation of mixed-methods, which I argue has a lens of homology, a diffractive methodology has a heterologous focus on the tensions, contradictions, and differences between the data that make a difference.</p>
        
        <p>One of the terms we inherited from Modernity is that of thinking about the sequential reality of events. What are the ways in which we can work with new materialist or Black feminist rethinking of temporality through the quantum, to account for the enfolding of temporal-spatial orders as a way that can produce and move towards something different? In <i>Inheriting Possibility</i> (Dixon-Román, 2017), I provide examples of diffractive analyses employing multiple methods, including quantitative methods, in order to the engage in an inquiry that accounts for the nonlinearity, the entanglements, and the discontinuities.</p>
        
        <p>Around 2012, while developing a data science and social policy program at the University of Pennsylvania, I began making moves toward interventions on machine learning, AI, and data science. I also became increasingly more interested in what measurement and statistics would call error or the stochastic term of a model, what information theory would call noise, and what for computation is indeterminacy, the incompressible, or the uncomputable.</p>
        
        <p>My interest in indeterminacies is to go after the ontoepistemologies that have been rendered irreducible, illegible, a para-ontology, that which exist parallel to, and even fugitive to the existing model of the system. Drawing from Luciana Parisi’s theorizing on the uncomputable, in any model, in any system, it's always a finite system. Every model is a finite model and whenever there's a limit there's something beyond that limit. Information theory assumes that information is infinite and dynamic in the world. As a result, any (finite) model will seek to compress infinities or indeterminate information, which will be incompressible or irreducible to its logic, or what Edouard Glissant called opacity. The uncomputable information is what information theorist and mathematician Gregory Chaitin called Omega. It is his mathematical solution to the Turing Halting problem and the unpredictability of when a system will halt. Parisi pushes us to think about Omega not as in the limits of computation but, based on second-order Cybernetics and post-Cybernetics, how the incompressibility of infinite information brought about radical developments in the development of autopoietic systems to self-regenerate or self-regulate beyond original condition. Parisi’s argument is that the uncomputable becomes a process for producing forms of software thought that are immanent to computation and ruptures open the potentiality for alterity.</p>
        
        <p>The problem of indeterminate information, I argue, is also a problem of colonialism. The question is, what does a finite system do with that which is indeterminate? This question is a critical question to systems of colonialism because the recursive systems of colonial and racial capitalism seek to maintain the changing same epistemology of European reason in order to reinforce power, reproduce difference, and manage the dispossessed, the subjected, and the nonbeing. We see this in various forms of machine learning and AI employed technologies in practices of governance such as predictive policing, learning analytics platforms, risk assessments in child welfare, the employment of biometrics in immigration and social welfare, or the IOF’s “The Gospel” AI warfare system, just to name a few. In each instance, we find colonial logics working through computation to scale, shape, control, and even annihilate the subject. What we also see in each instance is a recursive system of human-in-the-loop architectures, what Simon and Andrew Wiles termed the loop of politics. The aim for indigenous and Black feminist theorists and practitioners is to challenge the violence that stems from the recursive logic of computation. But not just to push back against the recursive logic, but to bring the recursions into the light in order to rupture open the system from within.</p>
        
        <p>My approach to thinking with the recursive systems of indeterminate information is to employ a diffractive analytic with multiple systems of knowledge and methodologies and what Vicki Kirby calls radical immanence, to think from within the system and explore how to rupture open other forms of computational imaginaries, such as those from Black feminist techno-critique. My aim is to explore the possibility of creating other system interfaces that come into contact with the politics of algorithms, data, and computation from the positionality of the racialized and dispossessed to regenerate new forms of technosocial practices. This work is ongoing. I’m currently working on a book project that rethinks indeterminate information within the frame of colonial technopolitics and Black feminist theory, as well as computational ontology.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you.</p>
