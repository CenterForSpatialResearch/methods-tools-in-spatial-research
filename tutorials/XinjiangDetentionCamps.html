        <p>LK: Alison, thanks so much for agreeing to do this. I know that you're really busy in your new job, but it would be horrible to not have anything from you.</p>

<p>AK: 12:31:39
Like, thank you so much. I really appreciate you organizing this so that I could take part in a few.</p>

<p>LK: Have you been able to leverage your skills and expertise in the built environment into your current work in journalism?</p>

<p>LK: 12:33:36
Do you see an opportunity for architects and spatial planners to work in? Well, that's the 1st part of the question. The second is, do you see this as a growing field, and things that other architects and spatial planners can work in the future.</p>

<p>AK: 12:33:53
Sure. The work that I do is for the most part very visual. So I'm working with satellite imagery. I'm working with video, with photography, working with 3D models, and links to the way that I would have worked as an architect as well.</p>

<p>AK: 12:35:06
When I was working with satellite imagery, people would ask me sort of like, How did you learn this? There's a very, very clear link to the way that you would work with satellite imagery to the way that you would work with plans, especially where you're very used to looking at something which has been reduced to a 2 dimensional view and understanding what that means in 3 dimensions, and doing the sort of analytical and associative work to understand what that drawing means. And so it was a very quick transition to using satellite imagery.</p>

<p>AK: 12:35:27
I think, as well, you're also used to many of the foundational skills that you need in order to do your location, which is similarly to be able to look at a photograph and to understand what that place might look like from above, and then to be able to locate that and locate yourself in that. So.</p>

<p>AK: 12:35:30
That would. It's actually a relatively short step to be able to do many of those things.</p>

<p>AK: 12:35:37
The sort of the 3 dimensional analysis and sort of 3D modeling.</p>

<p>AK: 12:35:43
Again, that's just something that you would do as an architect, and it's not that.</p>

<p>AK: 12:35:51
About differences that you're trying to achieve different things when you're using those skills as an architect. But it's it's quite a small skills gap between what you would be doing in architecture and what we're doing here for investigations.</p>

<p>LK: 12:36:05
Okay, that's a great answer.</p>

<p>AK: 12:36:06
At least as it relates to visual and spatial analysis.</p>

<p>LK: 12:36:13
Right. So it's the tools that are useful going from architecture to journalism, and it's not as if anybody ever treats you as if you're an architect per se, though.</p>

<p>AK: 12:36:31
I mean, I think that I now have enough of a track record that I'm much seen as a journalist.</p>

<p>LK: 12:36:37
That's great!</p>

<p>AK: 12:36:39
Yeah, I mean, certainly at the FT,</p>

<p>LK: 12:36:41
Right. You're a journalist. And so do you see this as something growing within the field of journalism that it's useful to have architectural training and that there's more opportunity for architects. For example, the people in a kind of program that I'm running in computational design, that they'll be able to apply for this kind of job in the future.</p>

<p>AK: 12:37:14
So I wouldn't put it as demand for architects within journalism. I don't think that's quite true. I think, though, what we have instead is like a growing, I mean, and it's something that's really happened over the past 10, 15, maybe even 20 years, that there's been a real growth in data, journalism, and then visual techniques and sort of open source techniques. And the journalism was very focused on testimony and very focused on the written word has started to open up to these others.</p>

<p>LK: 12:37:45
Right.</p>

<p>AK: 12:37:58
Like methods of reporting and investigation. I think the sorts of skills that I'm bringing in the sort of work that I do, I think is part of that continuum, where the field has just gradually opened up to people with a greater range of skills.</p>

<p>LK: 12:38:19
Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 12:38:21
Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 12:38:23
I mean, certainly the people who I know of several people who have architecture degrees, who have now made their way into journalism and made their way into newsrooms. And they're working in visual investigations, visual forensics teams. They're working in the graphics teams.</p>

<p>AK: 12:38:46
But that's seen very much as like or since, or graphic specialists, they're not 1st and foremost as architects, I would say.</p>

<p>LK: 12:38:58
Yeah, okay? Or as journalists in that, in that.</p>

<p>AK: 12:39:01
Oh, no, I mean they would be seen as journalists with graphics specialization.</p>

<p>LK: 12:39:11
So, Architecture and journalism often understand evidence very differently. Where journalism relies on eyewitnesses at the accident, and architecture creates evidence through spatial reconstruction and visual evidence. Since you're working on investigations from a distance and in many cases in low information environments due to highly sensor data or travel restrictions for journalists, what are methods of analysis and evidence building your team uses to communicate a high level of certainty and rigor for your audience?</p>

<p>LK: 12:40:00
So I think that also relates to the open source.</p>

<p>AK: 12:40:07
So there's a few things that we do. One is to try and be very transparent about how we've done our work, and how it is that we know what we know and help to step readers through the process by which we've learned. Something that we did, especially on the Xinjiang work, was to be also very clear about the level of certainty that we could bring to the work.</p>

<p>AK: 12:40:35
With Xinjiang because we couldn't go there, there was a real limit to what we could know. But at the same time, we were still able to produce results that we could report with a high degree of certainty. And so it was about that openness about that transparency with our audience, and that was really how we dealt with that issue.</p>

<p>LK: 12:41:16
So since your work, so that the question, the one question was, you know, constructing things from a distance and levels of certainty. So you're talking about the Xinjiang story. But what about other kinds of stories?</p>

<p>AK: 12:41:31
Yeah.</p>

<p>LK: 12:41:34
You know, news comes from.</p>

<p>LK: 12:41:39
From Twitter or Instagram, or unverified sources.</p>

<p>LK: 12:41:46
That seems like something that often.</p>

<p>LK: 12:41:49
That that can actually begin a story today. How do you? How do you deal with that? Methodologically? Or how do you deal with that methodologically as well?</p>

<p>AK: 12:41:54
How do you communicate that.</p>

<p>AK: 12:41:58
Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, I mean.</p>

<p>LK: 12:42:00
Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:02
This.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:02
The thing about the.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:04
The open source community has really developed over the past 10, maybe going on 15 years now, and.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:12
The way that that community and the way that that field actually developed was people working collaboratively online. And so the entire process by which people found out that information.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:27
From the.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:28
From the beginning. It would be public. It would be open that somebody would be saying like, "Hey, I found this thing. I know I found this other video, and I think it was taken here."</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:38
And it shows this and this and this, and they would be laying out their evidence. They would be sharing where they got it from, and the idea was.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:51
I mean, I'm not sure that they necessarily even intended that from the beginning, but it did become a.</p>

<p>AK: 12:42:58
A sort of very rigorous and collaborative way of doing these investigations, and it meant that people would often be called out if they said something that wasn't necessarily true or could be interpreted as incorrect. And I think that kind of level of openness and public accountability has really informed the way that we do our work as well. So everything that we do within our investigations is very collaborative.</p>

<p>LK: 12:43:08
Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 12:43:11
Which would be different from a lot of the news that would have been reported even in the very recent past.</p>

<p>LK: 12:43:14
Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 12:43:16
You know that you would have your reporter out in the field who would come back with their notebook and say, "Hey, I have the story."</p>

<p>AK: 12:43:25
And it's still very collaborative. We're not shy about sharing how it is that we found out about something or how it is that we found a piece of information and being really open about the way that we're interpreting the information that we have. So, so yeah.</p>

<p>LK: 12:43:52
So you were saying, like, before you were saying how like.</p>

<p>LK: 12:44:00
How journalism had relied heavily on eyewitness testimony.</p>

<p>LK: 12:44:06
Or like witness reports.</p>

<p>LK: 12:44:09
How does that combine in a way that that you have, for example, the visual reconstructions, or the satellite imagery.</p>

<p>LK: 12:44:12
How do those 2 things come together?</p>

<p>LK: 12:44:23
For your final output in a sense.</p>

<p>AK: 12:44:31
So, I mean, in some ways, what we're doing now is not that different to the way that you would.</p>

<p>AK: 12:44:35
I mean, it's just about.</p>

<p>AK: 12:44:37
You know, kind of diversifying the methods of gathering information. So in the past you would have relied very heavily on.</p>

<p>AK: 12:44:49
Um, eyewitness testimony as like the sort of.</p>

<p>AK: 12:44:56
Sort of the centerpiece, and that would be how you would get the story.</p>

<p>AK: 12:45:02
Whereas I think that with the sorts of techniques that we use now, with the techniques that we're developing, we're just introducing new layers of evidence and new layers of information. So it's still very, very common that you would use.</p>

<p>AK: 12:45:19
Or you'd be interviewing people who had been in a location who had seen something happen. But now you'd be supplementing that with the sort of spatial reconstruction. You'd be supplementing that with the satellite imagery with the video that you found. But.</p>

<p>AK: 12:45:36
But the point is that there's not necessarily a greater level of truth to one of those methods than the other, but that they support each other.</p>

<p>AK: 12:45:41
And so you'd be bringing them in together in a way that helps to contextualize what you've learned from your eyewitnesses.</p>

<p>LK: 12:45:48
That's great. That was a good answer.</p>

<p>LK: 12:45:50
Is there anything else that you wanted to bring up?</p>

<p>AK: 12:45:57
I can't really think of anything.</p>

<p>LK: 12:46:00
I thought that was great. I really appreciate your time.</p>

<p>AK: 12:46:04
Thank you very much. Thanks so much for asking me.</p>

<p>AK: 12:54:16 Direction with our team.</p>

<p>LK: 12:54:18 Okay.</p>

<p>AK: 12:54:20 Yeah.</p>

<p>LK: 12:54:20 Kind of so.</p>

<p>LK: 12:54:21 Right? So the next question will follow on to that. As part of your data collection and evidence-building process,</p>

<p>LK: 12:54:29 your team uses satellite imagery alongside video and images from social media platforms like Google Maps, YouTube, and Twitter.</p>

<p>LK: 12:54:38 With the increasing privatization and content censorship on these platforms, what obstacles do you see facing?</p>

<p>LK: 12:54:46 In the future for acquiring data. How do you see this impacting data collection or scraping from these sources?</p>

<p>AK: 12:54:59 So I don't think it's quite right to say scraping from those sources, although the fact that APIs have been taken down does mean that it's harder to investigate.</p>

<p>AK: 12:55:14 Networks on Twitter.</p>

<p>LK: 12:55:15 Hmm.</p>

<p>AK: 12:55:15 I think the challenge</p>

<p>AK: 12:55:19 especially around Twitter, is that it used to be this really powerful platform.</p>

<p>AK: 12:55:25 Where almost all journalists were on it, and it was a platform where, if you wanted to share news,</p>

<p>LK: 12:55:37 Right.</p>

<p>AK: 12:55:40 Twitter was where you would share it, and the algorithms in Twitter were very, very good for discovery, surfacing that information. If something happened—if there was a big explosion at the port in Beirut, if there were people storming the U.S. Capitol, if there was a protest where someone had been violently attacked by the police—you would hear about it on Twitter, and you would be seeing those videos, and they would be brought to the top.</p>

<p>AK: 12:56:03 What you would also have on Twitter were experts in all sorts of niche fields who would then be weighing in. And again, Twitter had this great discovery.</p>

<p>AK: 12:56:28 Yeah, it was very powerful for discovery that those people with this very specialist knowledge would also have expertise for others to benefit from. So Twitter was very, very powerful for that, and it really is a loss.</p>

<p>LK: 12:56:46 Right.</p>

<p>LK: 12:56:47 Has anything replaced it?</p>

<p>AK: 12:56:54 Not to the same extent. Twitter was also a place where the open-source community would gather and talk about, share, and collaborate on emerging stories.</p>

<p>LK: 12:57:07 Hmm.</p>

<p>AK: 12:57:12 I would say those communities have been scattered to a certain extent. People are still on Twitter, but many have moved to Blue Sky, Threads, or Mastodon, or they’ve moved to Discord. So those communities are much more fragmented now, and I think, to be honest, a lot of people have also just stopped posting.</p>

<p>LK: 12:57:34 Right.</p>

<p>AK: 12:57:35 They’re not rebuilding those communities elsewhere. In terms of discovery of imagery and videos, there isn’t a replacement. You’ll still find some stuff on Twitter, on Facebook; Telegram is probably the place to go in many countries.</p>

<p>LK: 12:58:14 Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 12:58:14 The challenge with Telegram is that often those channels are collating information from several other sources. It can be very difficult to trace back who originally posted it.</p>

<p>LK: 12:58:40 That’s right.</p>

<p>LK: 12:58:42 Telegram is a version of Signal as well, with more privacy protection than other social media platforms.</p>

<p>AK: 12:58:58 I didn’t hear the start of the question.</p>

<p>LK: 12:59:00 Hello, yeah. Telegram is similar. I just want you to explain what Telegram is, really.</p>

<p>AK: 12:59:09 Oh, wait! Sorry!</p>

<p>AK: 12:59:11 Telegram is a messaging app. You can do one-to-one messaging with friends or small groups, but it also has the capacity to build very big groups and broadcast groups where people disseminate news and information about events like protests. It’s quite effective for disseminating content.</p>

<p>LK: 12:59:45 Right.</p>

<p>LK: 12:59:51 In your recent work investigating Ukrainian children on Russian adoption sites, your team used an image recognition tool to identify and locate these missing children, but manually checked the top matches.</p>

<p>LK: 13:00:11 Similarly, in the article “How China is Tearing Down Islam,” your team compared satellite imagery across Baidu Maps, Google Maps, and OpenStreetMaps to identify changes in mosques across China.</p>

<p>LK: 13:00:24 With the growing trend in machine learning and image classification and segmentation, do you see an opportunity for your current work and your investigative team using these kinds of models?</p>

<p>AK: 13:00:41 Yeah, definitely. The Ukraine story was the first time that we’ve successfully used machine learning and image recognition programs.</p>

<p>AK: 13:00:56 The mosque story was slightly different in that one of my colleagues built a tool that allowed the wider team to look at pictures of mosques side by side and quickly identify changes. But it was still being done manually.</p>

<p>AK: 13:01:36 With the missing children, what’s really useful about these computational tools is that they help narrow down a vast dataset to a much smaller one, pointing you in the right direction. It helps focus your attention, and then you can manually check and follow up on the reporting.</p>

<p>LK: 13:02:38 Right? Okay.</p>

<p>LK: 13:02:40 What are some limitations when using predictive models in news reporting?</p>

<p>AK: 13:02:55 We already have very strict guidelines about what we can use it for. We don’t use generative AI for producing text or images.</p>

<p>LK: 13:03:02 Hmm.</p>

<p>AK: 13:03:08 Generative AI can be a powerful tool for speeding up aspects of reporting. It’s great for helping write code, for example, acting as a co-pilot.</p>

<p>LK: 13:03:30 Yeah.</p>

<p>AK: 13:03:41 It has the skill to go through text and find all the missing code that a human might miss. But we’re very careful about how we use it, and there’s always a need for a human in the loop.</p>

<p>LK: 13:03:46 Right.</p>

<p>AK: 13:04:08 The human, after narrowing down the dataset, still needs to manually check and verify the results. For example, with the missing Ukrainian children, we worked with Ukrainian authorities, but there was further follow-up where the authorities contacted the parents and guardians to confirm the identity. So there were many checks and balances in that process.</p>

<p>LK: 13:04:41 Hmm.</p>

<p>LK: 13:04:42 So that’s interesting—the distinction between what you use machine learning and AI for versus what you don’t, and the caution you take. That’s great.</p>

<p>LK: 13:05:08 I don’t want to go on for too long because we’re trying to get...</p>
