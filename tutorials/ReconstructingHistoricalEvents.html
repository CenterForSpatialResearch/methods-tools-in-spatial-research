                <h3>About the project</h3>

                <p>Babyn Yar Models is a project that spatially reconstructs the historical events of Babyn Yar around the transformations of its landscape. Working with maps, aerial photographs, photos, videos, eyewitness stories, and historical research, our team reconstructed the lost landscape of Babyn Yar and, through its transformations, followed the course of historical events.</p>

                <p>On September 29-30, 1941, more than 33,000 Jews were massacred in Babyn Yar. During the German occupation of Kyiv, between 100,000 and 150,000 people were killed there, including patients of the Kyiv City Psychiatric Hospital, Roma, Ukrainian nationalists, prisoners of war, and local authorities. Before retreating from Kyiv, the Nazis attempted to hide the traces of the massacres. Several hundred prisoners of war from the Syrets internment camp were forced to exhume and burn the remains of the dead.</p>

                <p>In the late 50s and early 60s, the landscape of Babyn Yar was fundamentally changed. The spurs were filled with liquid soil and covered over, resulting in the disappearance of the ravine as such. Highways were laid on the territory of Babyn Yar, and a residential area and a park were built. The area has changed so much that even historians argued about the exact location of the mass executions.</p>

                <p>In order to help better understand the important historical events of Babyn Yar, this  project reconstructs the landscape where those events happened.</p>

                <h3 id="image-match-guide">Guide overview</h3>

                <p>This guide outlines the general methodology for reconstructing a historical landscape using a variety of media sources. These sources include archival drawings, maps, aerial and satellite photographs, as well as ground-level photographs and videos. The guide describes the processes and techniques used to work with diverse data types – such as topographic maps and photogrammetry – to build a spatial model of a transformed landscape.</p>

            <h3 id="image-match-DEM">Building a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</h3>

                <p>We sourced topographic surveys and aerial photographs from different periods to build a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Babyn Yar. Using specialized software like AutoCAD, QGIS, Blender, and Grasshopper for Rhinoceros 3D, we navigated the challenges of integrating varying coordinate systems and correcting map distortions to accurately reconstruct the historical landscape.</p>

                <h4 id="image-match-source">Processing of Source Materials</h4>

                <p>Most source materials required significant pre-processing. Archival maps, for example, often had visible seams, and aerial reconnaissance photographs contained distortions. To ensure usability, we corrected these issues through alignment, calibration, and distortion adjustments. This involved preparing template files for each map sheet and using QGIS Georeferencer to align the maps to a 100x100 fathom orthogonal grid.</p>

                <h4 id="image-match-contour">Vectorization of Contour Lines</h4>

                <p>For topographic maps, color filters were applied to isolate contour lines, and superfluous elements were removed to enhance clarity. These images were then imported into a CAD environment, where each contour line was vectorized and elevated to its respective height using Bitonal mode. This crucial step allowed for the precise creation of a three-dimensional terrain model.</p>

                <p>
                    The process of geolocating of the historic photographs relies on the. By creating a detailed 3D model of the landscape as it existed in the past, historical images can be accurately placed within their geographical context. This method allows a deeper understanding of the historical site and the events that took place there, enhancing both the interpretation of photographs and the landscape itself, providing crucial insights for research and reconstruction.

                <p>
                    We worked with a diverse range of photographic materials, gathering images from various archives, tracking down originals, and carefully excluding pictures that were not actually from Babyn Yar (which were surprisingly numerous in Google search results for "Babyn Yar").
