        <p>In recent years, the rapid pace of technological evolution has profoundly impacted climate science, highlighting the unpredictability of our climate against new models of technology. These technologies, designed to question deeper timelines in the future, have revealed that telecommunications companies and high-speed networks, crucial to today's digital infrastructure, often obstruct the collection of atmospheric data1. As we address these challenges, new AI models are being developed to predict weather patterns by integrating high-quality observations with historical climate data. However, these models often struggle to detect extreme weather events because they are typically designed to ignore outliers2. This unpredictability has become a space of political conflict, fostering the development of counter-modeling practices that could harness tools and methodologies from Architecture and Design, potentially leading to new architectural agendas where unreal data and models might induce real environmental impacts.</p>

        <p>Img 1. Drag the screen left or right, and scroll down to explore the information.</p>

        <p>Climate science relies heavily on models3, but the complexity and uncertainty of the atmosphere's climate system mean these models must continually evolve4. It is essential to reconsider how we approach uncertainty as a condition of possibility within the complexities of weather and climate modeling5. From atmospheric parameters like water vapor, cloud cover, storm patterns, and moisture levels to ground data from antennas and radar systems, crowd-sourced databases, open-source information, and APIs—there are numerous sources that can reveal spatial correlations in diverse datasets6. By developing new aesthetics and languages of prediction, we can transform concrete aspects of climate into data and images that help remap our concept of unpredictability.</p> 

        <p>Counter-modeling, analogous to counter-mapping or counter-cartography, involves creating or using models that challenge conventional practices. This approach questions the assumptions, methodologies, or interpretations of standard models, aiming to highlight overlooked perspectives, address biases in traditional models, or explore alternative scenarios often neglected by conventional approaches. When models make predictions about worldly matters—such as climate and technology—people pay attention. For every action or development, there is a counterpart of radical experimentation that challenges and reshapes our understanding of what is possible.</p> 

        <p>Recent studies and scientific publications have highlighted the uncertainty of climate models, which integrate historical data with present-day observations to make predictions. However, questions arise about how these models might break down in the future, as every model inherently reflects choices about which elements to include and which to omit7. Discussing climate prediction brings up terms like "scale" and "models," inherently linked to design and architectural practices. Measuring this technologically significant space requires a methodological approach and precision. As we break down scientific notions, we must reconsider how we approach the complexities of weather and climate through new counter-modeling practices. The architecture of forecasting is crucial for providing accurate and timely weather information, and collecting essential weather and climate data requires sophisticated technologies and data models.</p>

        <p>As of the end of 2023, a significant development in the weather community was IBM and NASA's collaboration to build an AI foundation model for weather and climate8. The goal is to improve the speed, accuracy, and accessibility of weather forecasting and other climate applications. However, while new developments in math or computing enable progress, it’s easy to overestimate the power and elegance of modeling. So, how are models actually built? How much should we trust them, and why? The power of these models lies in their ability to generate predictions or original content with limited instructions from humans. The essential ingredient is data, something NASA has in abundance. Weather forecasting agencies now use several deep-learning models called AI emulators to generate forecasts based on historical weather patterns. As a result, AI weather prediction has emerged as a legitimate competitor to conventional models. However, the past is not always a great predictor of the future, especially with the rapid warming of the climate. Current AI models often miss extreme events due to their tendency to ignore outliers, a known problem for AI models that minimize the chance of big mistakes but consequently can miss extreme events2.</p> 

        <P>Weather forecasting accuracy has seen significant improvements in recent years, thanks to advancements in technology, particularly satellite observations. Nearly 99% of weather observations that supercomputers receive today come from satellites, with about 90% assimilated into computer weather models using complex algorithms. These numerical weather prediction models convert observations into a numerical representation of the atmosphere and advance it forward in time to make weather predictions. But what if the phenomenon you want to model is simply unmodellable?</P>

        <p>Reflecting on the uncertainty of climate models based on immutable physical laws, where historical data and present-day observations merge to make predictions, raises questions about how these models could break in the future, as all models reflect choices about what to include and omit7. As scientists propose a Category 6 for hurricanes surpassing what was once considered extreme7, we must consider the limitations of our models. Although for most people it is still difficult to understand the technical aspects of a foundation AI model in weather prediction, we can envision this model spatially. We've been discussing models and talking about scale, terms inherently linked to design and architectural practices. Measuring this technologically significant space requires a methodological approach and precision. As we break down scientific notions, we must reconsider how we approach the complexities of weather and climate in a new counter-modeling practice. This reevaluation leads to a deeper understanding of an invisible space of spatial and political conflicts, where multiple perspectives and scales are necessary to comprehend the interactions between diverse systems and processes.
        </p>

        <p>In this framework to visualize the uncertainty of data, NASA is currently committing to building an inclusive open science community over the next decade9. Open-source science aims to share software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) as early as possible in the scientific process. NASA's Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program ensures that these data are fully available to any user for any purpose, promoting and facilitating the open sharing of all metadata, documentation, models, images, and research results, along with the source code used to generate, manipulate, and analyze these data. NASA's complex database allows collaboration among many established disciplines. Over the past decade, NASA's open-source codes have been utilized in over 1,250 projects, with a significant increase in the number of these projects occurring in the last year10. Thanks to these open-source codes10, retrieving images from optical and radar satellites has become a new resource. All these data, numbers, and images encoded in numbers are accessible on the web and the cloud, in this sort of cyber atmosphere. We are empowered to access this information, but most of the time, we don’t have the knowledge to decode these data, which are encoded in complex structures. These critical dimensions of computational design and counter climate model practice try to crumble conventions and experiment with more radical tools to envision this space.
        </p>

        <p>New aesthetics and languages of prediction help modulate concrete aspects of climate into data and images that re-map our conception of the atmosphere through a counter-cartography practice. This approach poses questions along deeper timelines in the future, aiming to build a new vocabulary around an uncertain future where critical practices stretch their boundaries, adapting and transforming. For a model to be successful, it must replicate the known while generalizing into the unknown. New knowledge pushes models forward, understanding spatial and design practices as a space where different fields and branches of science and art intersect conceptually and visually, provoking new vibrant aesthetics. Using critical computation as active tools, we can redraw the space of uncertainty, opening new possibilities for understanding and engaging with our changing world.
