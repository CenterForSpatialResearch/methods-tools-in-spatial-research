                    <h2 style:>A conversation with Allison Killing, Senior Visual Investigations Reporter at the Financial Times, on her training in architecture, the open source community, and using computational tools in journalism. Interview prepared by Laura Kurgan and Adeline Chum.</h2>

                <!-- <p style="font-style: italic;">Interview Coming Soon</p> -->
                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    Laura Kurgan: Alison, thanks so much for agreeing to do this. I know that you're really busy with your new job. 
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    Alison Killing: Thank you so much. I really appreciate you organizing this, so that I could take part in everything.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: As a trained and licensed architect, how have you been able to leverage your skills and expertise in the built environment, 3D modeling and spatial analysis into your current work in journalism?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: The work that I do is for the most part very visual. I'm working with satellite imagery, video, photography, 3D models, and there are very clear links to the way that I would have worked as an architect as well. It was a very quick jump to using satellite imagery from the way that you would work with plans. Especially, where you're very used to looking at something which has been reduced to a two-dimensional view and understanding what that means in three-dimensions, and doing the sort of analytical and associative work to understand what that drawing means. I think, as well, you're also very used to many of the foundational skills that you need in order to understand your location. Similarly, the same techniques are used to be able to look at a photograph,understand what that place might look like from above and then to be able to locate that and locate yourself. It's actually a relatively short step to be able to do many of those things; the three-dimensional analysis and 3D modeling. That's just something that you would do as an architect. There are differences. You're trying to achieve different things when you're using those skills as an architect, but there's quite a small skills gap between what you would be doing in architecture and what we're doing here for investigations; at least as it relates to visual and spatial analysis.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: So it's the spatial and visual tools that are useful going from architecture to journalism, and it's not as if anybody ever treats you as an architect per se. 
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: I think that I now have enough of a track record that I'm very much seen as a journalist, certainly at the FT (Financial Times). 
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: Do you see change in trajectory as something growing within the field of journalism? An opening where it's useful to have architectural, or spatial computational training, and being able to tell stories with data as a complement to narrative investigations.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: I wouldn't put it as a demand for architects within journalism. I don't think that's quite true. It's something that's really happened over the past ten, fifteen, maybe even twenty years. There's been a real growth in data journalism and in visual and open source techniques. Journalism, traditionally very focused on testimony and very focused on the written word, has started to open up to these other methods of reporting and investigation. I think the sorts of skills that I'm bringing is part of that continuum, where the field has just gradually opened up to people with a greater range of skills. Certainly, I know of several people who have architecture degrees, who have now made that way into journalism and made that way into newsrooms. They're working in visual investigations, visual forensics teams, and in the graphics teams. But, they’re seen very much as graphic specialists and not as architects. I would say they would be seen as journalists with graphics specialization.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: Architecture and journalism often understand evidence very differently, where journalism relies on eye witnesses at the incident and architecture creates evidence through spatial reconstruction and visual evidence. Since you are often working on investigations from a distance and in many cases in a low information environment, due to highly censored data or travel restrictions for journalists. What are methods of analysis and evidence building your team uses to communicate a high level of certainty and rigor to your audience? So, I think that also relates to the idea about open source.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: There's a few things that we do. One is to try and be very transparent about how we've done our work, how it is that we know what we know and help to step readers through the process by which we've learned. Something that we did especially on the Xinjiang work was to be also very clear about the level of certainty that we could bring to the work. With Xinjiang because we couldn't go there, there was a real limit to what we could know. But, at the same time, we were still able to produce results that we could report with a high degree of certainty. And so it was about that openness and about that transparency with our audience, and that was really how we dealt with that issue.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK:  We have all learned a lot from your work in Xinjiang. It seems that often stories like this emerge from news coming from Twitter, Instagram, or unverified and open source communities. How do you deal with that methodologically?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: The open source community has really developed over the past 10, maybe going on 15 years now. The way that community and the way that that field actually developed was people working collaboratively online. So, the entire process by which people found out that information was from the public and open from the beginning. For example, somebody would say, “Hey, I found this thing, or I found this other video, and I think it was taken here. It shows x and y and z.” –  They would be laying out their evidence. They would be sharing where they got it from. I'm not sure this was all intentional from the beginning, but it did become a sort of key tentative start to open source research  – the result was that anybody else can go and reproduce the results that you've produced. This was such an important phase for all of us in the open source news community.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: Right. Can you think of an example from early on in that terrain that caught you by surprise, or got you hooked on this type of open source research methodology? I remember Bellingcat, for example. 
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Yeah, I think Bellingcat’s MH17 investigation was really like a classic example of this. This massive group of people, working online and a very disparate group. There were people sitting at their computers all over the world. There were some journalists who were based in Ukraine, and would occasionally have an afternoon where they didn't have anything else to do, so they would drive off to find stories in hopes to discover some truths. It was this massive collaborative effort by a group of people who were doing this in their free time. 
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: But now it's become much more professionalized. Right?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Yes, that's true.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: Right. And so how do you see that transformation? How and why did that professionalization happen?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: I think the professionalization really happened because people started to see the value of it. The work that Bellingcat did with MH17 was really groundbreaking. Open source techniques have allowed reporters, researchers, online amateur enthusiasts to solve problems that just hadn't been solvable previously that the traditionalists, police, and intelligence agencies had really struggled with. It was that realization that there were new sources of information, and new ways of working that could produce big breakthroughs that then led to the professionalization. Then, newsrooms started to say, “Hey, there's real value in this. It can allow us to report stories that would be very difficult to report otherwise, because they take place in places that are very difficult to get to or too dangerous to get to.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: My next question asks some of what you're already saying. Even though so much of your work is using methods and tools from a distance, how and where do you compensate for voices on the ground? How do you validate sources, and how do you collaborate with conventional reporting in any news organization you work in?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Yes, this adds to your previous question about the professionalization; open-source methods afford the opportunity to look at instances that you can't otherwise look at and some of that is because it might be too far away. But the other side of that coin is that because everyone now has cell phones, really rich sources of information have emerged that didn't previously exist. There are social media platforms which are hosted for free and they can be easily, publicly available. These are all really big changes.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: Changes and dangers in some cases, no? Especially in today's era of misinformation, validation on the ground and validation based on what's circulating around may be required. 
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Anytime that we're finding material online, we are looking to verify it and check that it really did happen in that place and time, or that we are being led to believe that it did. These two questions have from the start been key to open source investigations. That sort of verification and geolocation is key to open source research because you can't use the mass of video and imagery that is available on the Internet if you can't be confident that it shows what you think that it does. You can't draw any conclusions about it, unless it really does show what you think it does.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: I understand, this is a complicated process. Nevertheless, I do want to talk about the relationship between people on the ground versus social media based reporting. How do you collaborate with more conventional journalists in the department, do they accept these new methods, or how do they complement this kind of work?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Yeah, I mean, we work very closely with more traditional reporters. In fact, our team also does a fair amount of that more traditional reporting, where we are doing interviews and speaking with people in the place who have been involved in, or who have seen the incident in question. It's valuable for a few reasons, one absolutely is corroboration, as you suggested. The other is that there's a limit to what you can do with open source and there's a limit to the sorts of stories that you can tell. One of the things that you would want, especially from speaking to someone, is that you would want to get a sense of the human story, and to understand what this incident means. You want to understand what it felt like to be there and what the impact is on the people who were there. You want to know what it means in a wider context and that's something that open source can't deliver and you need more traditional reporting to support that.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK:  Great, so so far, we can say that Visual Investigation is a field that has grown out of an online community open to experimenting with new methods of critical research and reporting. It has been adopted into many news agencies. The format of this reporting allows for deeper investigations into an incident, layering multiple sources of information including the compilation of datasets and production of new evidence. Being part of the visual investigations team at the Financial Times, how has news reporting evolved since the formalization of this department and are there particular visual storytelling methods you find that helps bring together the different types of evidence and allows readers to interact with the evidence and material more closely?
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    Or, to put it more simply, how have you developed your methods since your new position at the Financial Times? What kind of department have they formalized there?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: I'm not sure that I've really changed my methods. The FT set up the visual Investigations team in October last year and it was because they saw the potential in the work of people like me doing visual investigations, doing open source and what that could deliver for them. They were keen to do this very innovative work. There was already a visual storytelling team at the FT which had focused mostly on explanatory work. When I joined, part of the idea with the visual investigations team was that we would expand that work to focus on investigations. So, stories that would be finding out things that weren't already known. I'm also very interested in the accountability angle around human rights or corruption, things like that.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: What do you mean by those kinds of accountability questions? Can you expand a little bit.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: I mean rather than producing explanatory work. For example, some of the work that the team did around Ukraine explained from where Europe got its gas, as it seemed that the gas from Russia was likely to be cut off, the question that immediately followed was, where does Europe get its gas from and they explained that. Or they did a piece last week about how you build the world's fastest running shoes. They did a great story just after Christmas about whether we can use AI to talk to animals. So, that team's work was very much in the explanatory field of reporting and we are moving into a much more investigative direction with our team.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: As part of your data collection and evidence-building process, your team uses satellite imagery alongside videos and images sourced from social media platforms like Google Maps, YouTube and Twitter/X. With the increasing restrictions on access to purchasing satellite imagery, and content censorship on social media platforms, what obstacles do you see facing in the future for acquiring data? And how do you see this impacting data collection or scraping from these sources?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: So, I don't think it's quite right to say scraping from those sources, although the fact that Twitter’s API has been taken down does mean that it's harder to investigate networks on Twitter. I think the challenge, especially around Twitter, is that it used to be this really powerful platform where, I would say, all journalists were on it. It was a platform where, if you wanted to share news, Twitter was where you would share it. The algorithms in Twitter were very, very good for discovery and for surfacing that information. If something happened, if there was a big explosion at the port in Beirut, if there was a lot of people storming the US Capitol, if there was a protest where somebody had been violently attacked by the police, you would hear about it on Twitter, and you would be seeing those videos, and they would be brought to the top of one’s news feed. And what you would also have on Twitter was a lot of experts in all sorts of niche fields who would then be weighing in. Again, Twitter was just so very powerful for discovery, People with very specialist knowledge would also have their expertise surfaced for others to benefit from.  All that has now disappeared on Twitter and it really is a loss.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: Has anything replaced it?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Not to the same extent. Twitter was also a place where the open source community would gather to talk about and would share sort of emergent stories and gather to collaborate. I would say that those communities have been scattered to a certain extent. Some people are still on Twitter, but there are a lot of people who may have moved to Bluesky, Threads, Mastodon or they've moved to Discord. Those communities are much more fragmented now. And I think to be honest, a lot of people have also just stopped posting. When the online community that was built on Twitter went away, journalists and people weren't looking to do that work all over again, or rebuild a new community somewhere else.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    In terms of the discovery of imagery and of videos, there isn't something that has really replaced it. You will still find some stuff on Twitter. You will find some stuff on Facebook. Telegram is probably the place to go in many countries. The challenge with Telegram is that often those channels are collating information from several other channels [and] from several other sources. Maybe those channels have brought people in and have gotten those videos directly and shared them, but it can be very difficult to trace back from Telegram who it was that originally posted.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: That's right. Telegram is a version of Signal which has more protection, privacy, protection than other social media platforms. Could you explain what Telegram is?
                 </p>

                 <p>
                    AK: Telegram is a messaging app, in many ways, comparable to Whatsapp, because you can do one on one messaging with your friends or small group of friends. But, it also has the capacity to build very big groups and to build broadcast groups. So, you can have very large groups where people disseminate news and spread information about protests for example, and many other kinds of news events. So, it's quite effective for disseminating content.
                 </p>

                 <p class="CSR-text">
                    LK: I’d like to turn for a moment to some methodological questions. In your recent work investigating Ukrainian children on Russian adoption sites, your team uses an image recognition tool to identify and locate missing children, but then you manually checked the top matches. Similarly in the article, “How China is tearing down Islam”, your team compared satellite imagery across Baidu Maps, Google Maps, and OpenStreetMaps to identify changes in mosques across China. With the growing trend of machine learning and image classification/segmentation, do you see an opportunity for your current work and investigative team using these models?
